# Building-Escape

Building Escape is a simple room escape game made with Unreal Engine and C++. The main purpose of the game is to find a way to escape the room, which is by finding the correct items to place on hidden pressure plates. This is a beta version of the game, made from the ground up by me during the Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games course on Udemy https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/. The assets were found on the Unreal Engine Marketplace.

## Topics covered in this project:
    C++, the games industry standard language.
    How to use the Unreal Engine 4 Editor.
    Git as a version control and backup system.
    Object Oriented Programming and how to put it into practice.
    Sound effects and audio to add depth to your games.
    Game design principles.
    Programming patterns and best practices.
    Unreal's Terrain Editor to create epic landscapes.
    Artificial Intelligence behaviour programming for enemies.

    Modern game development technologies and techniques.
    A fundamental understanding of computers.
    Write code that is clean and to understand.
    Unreal Gameplay Framework to make games easily.
    Advanced vehicle physics.
    Blackboard and Behaviour Tree for customizable AI.
    Animation Blueprint for custom character animation.
    C++ template programming to reduce repetition.
    Vector maths for game play and physics calculations.
 
Now, I wanted to take a Video Preview of my game, but my computer specs are too low so whenever I record the game is super laggy and dissapointing, instead, I hope these images would suffice:
